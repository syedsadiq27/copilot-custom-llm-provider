# Changelog

## v0.0.1 — June 2026

### Initial release

- Initial release, inspired by [vscode-custom-llm-provider](https://github.com/milhaus123/vscode-custom-llm-provider)
- Repository: [syedsadiq27/copilot-custom-llm-provider](https://github.com/syedsadiq27/copilot-custom-llm-provider)
- Extension ID: `introfinity.copilot-custom-llm-provider`

---

## v0.4.8 — May 2026

### Bug fixes

- **Fixed:** Clicking "Add Models" → "Custom LLM" in the Copilot model picker showed no input fields (name / URL / API key dialogs never appeared).
  - Root cause: VS Code 1.104+ keeps the model-picker webview panel in focus when it calls the `managementCommand`. Any `showInputBox` opened synchronously inside that handler was immediately dismissed by the webview stealing focus, causing `cmdAddProvider` to silently exit before the user could type anything.
  - Fix: added a 200 ms settle-time at the start of `cmdAddProvider` so the picker panel fully closes before the first native input dialog opens.

---

## v0.4.7 — May 2026

### Bug fixes

- **Fixed:** Custom models (e.g. `qwen35-397`) could not be invoked from Copilot Chat — Copilot looped on auxiliary `gpt-4o-mini` (`.copilotmd`) requests and the user's actual chat turn never reached our provider.
  - Root cause: previous versions wrote our model IDs into `github.copilot.chat.customOAIModels` (Copilot's BYOK settings) **in addition** to registering them through our `LanguageModelChatProvider`. When Copilot saw the same model ID in both places it sometimes routed via the BYOK path, didn't find an API key in Copilot's own secret storage, failed silently, and kept retrying the auxiliary model selection logic in a loop.
  - Removed the `syncCopilotPickerModels` write entirely — the chat provider already publishes its models to the picker via `provideLanguageModelChatInformation` + `showInModelPicker: true`, no second registration is needed.
  - On startup the extension now also **cleans up** any stale entries that earlier versions left in `customOAIModels` (foreign BYOK entries are preserved).

---

## v0.4.5 — April 2026

### Bug fixes

- **Fixed:** Original GitHub Copilot models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) appeared to lose the user's prompt and reply with "what do you need?" while context climbed to ~95%, in a loop.
  - Root cause: the `@qwen` chat participant was declared `isSticky: true`, so once invoked it kept hijacking every subsequent turn even after the user switched models in the picker. In agent mode, where the actual content lives in references/tool calls rather than `request.prompt`, the participant forwarded an empty user message → the model asked for input → Copilot resent the (still empty) prompt → infinite loop.
  - Now `isSticky: false` — `@qwen` only routes the turn it explicitly appears in.
  - The participant also bails out with a clear warning instead of forwarding an empty `User('')` message.
- **Fixed:** `syncCopilotPickerModels()` was overwriting the entire `github.copilot.chat.customOAIModels` setting on every config change, wiping any BYOK models the user (or another extension) had configured. The function now **merges** instead — only entries owned by Custom LLM Provider are touched.
- **Fixed:** Write-amplification in the configuration watcher — `discoverAllModels` writes to `customLlm.models`, which fired the watcher, which called `syncCopilotPickerModels` again on every cycle. The watcher now reacts only to `customLlm.providers` and `customLlm.models`, and skips the redundant picker sync.

---

## v0.4.4 — April 2026

### Bug fixes
- **Fixed:** API key field was not visible in Settings UI when adding a new provider
  - Added `required` attribute to provider schema to ensure all fields (name, baseUrl, apiKey) are displayed in the VS Code Settings editor

---

## v0.4.3 — April 2026

### New features
- **Image/vision support** — attach images directly in Copilot Chat
  - The image attachment button is now enabled for all models — VS Code no longer shows images as crossed out
  - Images are converted to base64 `data:image/...` URLs and sent in the standard OpenAI multipart content format
  - If the selected model does not support images, a clear error message is shown: `"This model does not support image input. Use a multimodal model (e.g. qwen-vl-max)..."`
  - Non-image data parts (JSON, binary) are silently ignored

### Improved error messages
- API error responses are now parsed as JSON — users see the human-readable message instead of a raw JSON blob
- 400 errors mentioning "image", "vision", or "unsupported" show a specific helpful message with a suggestion to use a multimodal model
- 401 error message updated to reference the new `Custom LLM: Manage providers` command

---

## v0.4.2 — April 2026

_(superseded by v0.4.3 — do not use)_

---

## v0.4.1 — April 2026

### Bug fixes
- **Fixed:** Adding a second provider via the wizard (`Custom LLM: Add provider`) did not load the new provider's models or update the model picker
- **Fixed:** Adding a provider directly in `settings.json` did not trigger model discovery — models were never fetched for the new provider
- The config watcher now calls `GET /v1/models` when `customLlm.providers` changes (e.g. manual settings edit), preventing a discovery loop when only the model list changes
- `Custom LLM: Add provider` now explicitly notifies VS Code that the model list has changed after discovery completes

---

## v0.4.0 — April 2026

### Multi-provider support
- **New:** Add unlimited providers — each with its own Base URL and API key
- **New command:** `Custom LLM: Add provider` — guided wizard (name → URL → API key → auto-discover models)
- **New command:** `Custom LLM: Manage providers` — list, edit, or remove configured providers
- Each model is now tagged with its `providerUrl` so requests always go to the correct endpoint
- `provider.ts` routes each request to the right API key based on the model selected

### Dynamic model discovery
- On startup the extension calls `GET /v1/models` for every configured provider
- Models from all providers are merged into a single list in the Copilot Chat picker
- **New command:** `Custom LLM: Refresh model list from API` — manually reload at any time
- Falls back to built-in defaults when the endpoint is unreachable or no key is set

### Automatic migration
- Existing `customLlm.baseUrl` + `customLlm.apiKey` settings are migrated to the new `customLlm.providers` array automatically on first start — no manual action needed

### Settings changes
- **New:** `customLlm.providers` — array of `{ name, baseUrl, apiKey }`
- **Deprecated:** `customLlm.baseUrl` and `customLlm.apiKey` (still read for migration)

---

## v0.3.0 — April 2026

### Dynamic model discovery
- Extension fetches available models from `GET /v1/models` on startup
- Falls back to hardcoded defaults if the endpoint is unavailable

### Auto-migration of token limits
- On update, existing model settings are automatically updated with corrected context sizes

### Correct context window sizes
- `qwen3.6-plus`: 1M context, 65K output
- `qwen3.5-plus`: 1M context, 16K output
- `kimi-k2.5`: 256K context, 32K output
- `glm-5`: 200K context, 16K output
- `MiniMax-M2.5`: 256K context

### Better 401 error message
- When API key is invalid or missing, the error now shows a clear instruction to run `Custom LLM: Configure endpoint & API key`

---

## v0.2.0 — April 2026

### New models
All models from Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan added out of the box:
- `qwen3.6-plus` (1M context)
- `glm-5`, `glm-4.7` (Zhipu)
- `kimi-k2.5` (Moonshot)
- `MiniMax-M2.5` (MiniMax)

### Auto-merge of new models
- When updating the extension, any new default models are automatically added to the user's model list without overwriting custom entries

---

## v0.1.0 — March 2026

### `@qwen` chat participant
- Type `@qwen` in Copilot Chat to always route to your custom model
- Supports model selection by name: `@qwen qwen3-coder-plus refactor this`

### Tool calling & agent mode
- Full tool calling support: agent mode, `/fix`, `/edit`, `@workspace` all work

### Retry logic
- Automatic exponential backoff on 429 (rate limit) and 5xx (server errors)
- 3 retries with delays of ~1s, ~2s, ~4s (max 10s), with ±30% jitter
- Cancellation is never retried

### Initial model list
- `qwen3-coder-plus`, `qwen3-coder-next`, `qwen3-max`, `qwen3.5-plus`

---

## v0.0.1 — March 2026

- Initial release
- Basic OpenAI-compatible provider registered in VS Code Copilot Chat
